These are the icons numbers I have used to distinguish the main types of weathers to use the videos as a background.


1. Clear weather => 01d or 01n
2. Cloudy weather => 02d or 03d or 04d / 02n or 03n or 04n
3. Haze and foggy weather => 50d
4. Snowy weather => 13d
5. Rainy and Drizzle weather => 10d or 9d
6. Lightning and Thunderstorm weather => 11d
